    "\n",
    "  - It is assumed that your SSH keys are located in your home directory in the hidden directory `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. In case you have them stored somewhere else, you have to modify the line `config.ssh.private_key_path = '~/.ssh/id_rsa'` in the below Vagrant file accordingly.\n",

Furthermore, the `Vagrantfile` assumes that you have set the environment variable `$DIGITAL_OCEAN_TOKEN` to the API token, which you receive from DigitalOcean, see [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/)\n",
